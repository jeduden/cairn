The model never grows: a model edit is a concept sentence or a citation and leaves the file no longer. docs/srs/invariants.md never changes; a theme whose fix would need it is blocking and says so in its reason. Each SRS file stays at or under 8000 tokens at 1.33 tokens a word: 05b-lane-requirements.md has no room left, so an edit there must not add words. Every edit's old must be an exact, unique substring of the current file. The scenario step goes into the @pending scenario tagged with the requirement whose row the fix edits (grep features/ for the tag); a requirement whose scenario is not @pending cannot take one, so choose the row whose scenario is.`
