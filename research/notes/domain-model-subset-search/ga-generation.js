Decide the repairs yourself, no rulings are given: fix every needs-fix finding whose fix tightens, narrows, deletes or clarifies, inside its feature's span (core text for "core"; nest spans when a fix needs another feature). Fix plainly right minors the same way. Prefer one sentence that settles a family of findings over a clause per finding; prefer deleting to adding; add no concept. Skip a finding that is wrong, that needs a stakeholder decision, that would weaken an invariant, or that asks for a new concept or mechanism. Settled by the stakeholder, keep as is: the principal's own tunnel and git push are its tools outside I4; room trailers are always on; a run's tool process running as the principal's own OS user is §6.1's residual risk R1-R7. Leave invariants.md.ann's text alone.
Write WORK/repair-v${next}-log.md: a heading, then per finding its candidate and index, fixed (before -> after) or skipped (why). Then run: cd ${work} && ${env} python3 check_annotation.py --no-orig (must print OK), and assemble genomes/_test-min.json (core only) into out/v${next}-core to read the core.
