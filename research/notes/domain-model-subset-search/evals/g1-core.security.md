The room-act MCP tools (room_pin, room_edit, room_unpin, room_link, room_create) and CLI calls from inside a run that are not reads (cairn ingest, rebuild, migrate, a pin command) also return output that the harness sends to the model. That output is neither enveloped recall nor a closed path, and nothing bounds it: ingest could echo an attacker's unparsed line, or room_edit could echo pin text.
