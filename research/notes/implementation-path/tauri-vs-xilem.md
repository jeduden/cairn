# Tauri 2, Electron and Xilem, for five platforms and the browser

Scope: a full comparison of the two Rust UI paths for Cairn's app,
written 4 October 2026 for the stakeholder's target of Linux, Windows,
macOS, iOS, Android and a browser (Cairn hosted as a web service).
Tauri 2 is option D's shell: the UI is a web page in the platform's
webview. Xilem on Masonry and Vello is option I's toolkit: the core
draws the UI on the GPU. Licences and crate counts were measured here
with `cargo metadata` on a scratch crate per stack (Tauri 2.12.1,
Xilem 0.4.0) for each target; build times were measured on a 4-core
Linux container; the rest is sourced.

## Licences in detail

- **Tauri.** The MPL-2.0 crates are `cssparser`, `cssparser-macros`,
  `dtoa-short` and `selectors`, reached through `dom_query` from
  `tauri-utils` inside `tauri-macros`, a proc-macro that runs at build
  time; `option-ext`, through `dirs`, ships in the binary. MPL-2.0 is
  file-level copyleft and off ENG-18's list; using an unmodified crate
  is usually fine in law, but the list forbids it as written.
- **Xilem.** Nothing copyleft. BSL-1.0, CC0-1.0, Zlib and Unicode-3.0
  are permissive but also off the list as written.
- **Both** need ENG-18's list widened to the permissive licences they
  carry (Zlib, Unicode-3.0), and Tauri needs a ruling on MPL-2.0 or a
  replacement for `dirs`.
- **System libraries.** Tauri links the platform's webview: WebKitGTK
  is LGPL-2.1 and loaded dynamically on Linux; WebView2 and WKWebView
  are vendor components. Xilem ships none.

## The browser decides most of it

Hosting Cairn as a web service means a sixth surface, the browser.

- **Tauri's page is already a web app.** Cairn's own server (Rust, in
  the core's boundary) serves the same bundle, and the calls the page
  makes through Tauri's IPC go over HTTP and a WebSocket instead. One
  UI codebase serves all six surfaces, with the browser's
  accessibility, IME, find and copy for free.
- **Xilem needs two UIs.** Masonry draws natively; in a browser,
  `xilem_web` builds DOM elements with its own views, so the room is
  written twice. Running Masonry and Vello on a WebGPU canvas instead
  would have no accessibility, since AccessKit has no web adapter.
- **Either way the hosted service is a new boundary.** A server that
  people reach from a browser is B3, or an owner-run node under B2
  rules: the per-launch token, SEC-20's credential rules, WebAuthn and
  rate limits move from loopback to the network. CON-06 allows it only
  when the owner runs it, never as a central service.

## Electron against Tauri 2

Electron keeps the web page, so the browser comes free as with Tauri,
but it changes what the page runs in on the desktop.

Electron's one real gain is a single rendering engine on the
desktops. It does not remove WebKit from the test matrix, because iOS
allows only WKWebView, and it costs a Node runtime in the trusted path,
CON-03, the reach evidence, a 120 MB-plus download and a Chromium
release train. Tauri 3's bundled-Chromium runtime, in alpha, may give
the same consistency without Node ([five platforms](five-platform-apps.md)).

## What this means for the options

- **D (Rust core, Tauri) fits five platforms plus the browser with one
  UI.** Its costs are the system webviews (vendor diagnostics,
  WebKitGTK on Linux), HTML handling of untrusted text, and MPL-2.0 in
  the build.
- **I (Rust core, drawn UI) loses its main promise in the browser:**
  "one UI, drawn once" becomes two UIs, and Xilem's phones and maturity
  lag. Its gains (clean licences, no HTML parsing of agent text, no
  webview frame) do not outweigh a second UI unless the browser is a
  reduced surface.
- **Electron** buys one desktop engine at the cost of Node, CON-03,
  size and a release train; Tauri covers more platforms with less, and
  Tauri 3's bundled Chromium is the better answer to WebKit
  differences once it leaves alpha.
- **The Go family (A to C) and H** follow the same split: a web page
  reaches the browser for free; a drawn UI does not.
