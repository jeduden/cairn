Round 33 standing review of docs/srs/ and features/*.feature against components-and-surfaces.md

**Result:** I found 9 defects. 6 need a fix and 3 need a ruling from the stakeholder. All of them are naming slips or gaps around the component and surface boundary. None needs new invariant wording.

**Clean:**

- The Component column of §6.3 holds the same six components as the model: core, room-view component, launcher, peer, publish and bridge component.
- Every id my file cites exists and says what my file says: I4, OQ-32, §6.3, ADM-04, SEC-01, LANE-28, SEC-20, VIEW-03, OWN-16, CMP-05, VIEW-14, VIEW-08, VIEW-05, I6, I7, SEC-23, VIEW-22, §9.2.
- I4, I6 and I7 read the same in invariants.md, my file, SEC-01, SEC-19, SEC-29, ENG-12, ENG-16, VIEW-18 and SEC-23.
- The surface names are used consistently across the SRS and the scenarios: Fleet, Room page, Catch up, Needs you, Health with its Setup part, Peers, context lens, quarantine list, forensic view, outcome window and harness strip.
- None of the excluded terms appears: "run component", "lane view", "trusted boundary".
- "Boundary" is always qualified when it is not a network boundary ("memory boundary", "span boundary kind", "crate boundaries").

**Findings, most important first:**

1. **`cairn ui --phone` (question).**

  - My file says the CLI is `cairn` "but for `cairn ui`". It also says the room-view component records only "the principal acts taken in it", that is, in the browser room view.
  - Yet OWN-16, §9.5 row 80, §4.2 and the OWN-16 scenario make `cairn ui --phone` a widening principal act taken at a terminal, citing OWN-12 ("every CLI verb").
  - OWN-02 accepts a terminal act only from "the CLI or TUI", and refuses an act from anywhere else. trust-and-flow.md's Principal surface says the same.
  - So no principal surface or component in the model covers this act. OQ-39 and OQ-40 sit next to it, but neither decides it.
  - The hub's Names section also counts `ui` and `launch` among the CLI's commands. "CLI" therefore carries two meanings.

2. **OQ-40's scope (question).** OQ-40 and the §6.3 note list only the room-view component, the launcher and the bridge component (rows 8, 10, 20 and 21). But SEC-25 has the peer component record each refused segment as REC-21's structural event, in a writer the core seals. SEC-10's open mark already says "another component", so the gap is only in OQ-40's wording. record.md's recorder list also omits the peer component; that belongs to the record specialist.

3. **CON-03 "webview" (question).** CON-03 lets the browser room view client run "in a webview". My file's closed list of clients names only the browser, served through the room-view component. No row in §6.3 says how a webview reaches the record. The wording runs ahead of ADR-2610042341, which is still proposed.

4. **security.feature:242 (needs-fix).** The SEC-20 scenario title says "the room view binds to loopback". Binding is the room-view component's job.

5. **security.feature:276 (needs-fix).** The SEC-22 example "every boundary disabled" would include B0. Managed policy can disable only B1, B2 and B3.

6. **administration.feature:47–64 (needs-fix).** The ADM-04 outline's `component` column holds "cairn status", which is not a component.

7. **"UI" used as a name for the room view (needs-fix, three places).**

  - 06-security.md:56, threat T15
  - 09b-lane-vocabulary.md:106–107
  - index.md:15, the Implementation language row

8. **12-delivery-plan.md:50 (needs-fix).** It writes "catch-up" where the surface is named "Catch up".

**Instruction feedback:**

- The hub's Names section counts `ui` and `launch` as CLI commands, while my file says "the CLI" excludes them. The instructions don't say whether my file or the hub (the domain-model agent) owns the meaning of "CLI".
- Several findings span my file and another specialist's file (for example, trust-and-flow's Principal surface). The instructions don't say whether to file those as "question" or "other-specialist".
- The JSON `file` field takes a single path, but "group repeats" pulls the other way. I split the three "UI" uses into separate entries.
- It is unclear whether proposed ADRs may be read for context. I read ADR-2610042341 to judge the CON-03 finding; plan/ and research/ were not opened.
