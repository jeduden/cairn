## Pins-and-context review of the SRS and scenarios at HEAD (round 33, blind)

I found 13 defects in the SRS and scenarios: 9 need fixes, 2 are questions for the stakeholder, and 2 belong to other specialists. None needs new invariant wording.

**What I checked:**

- Every concept in `/home/user/cairn/docs/domain-model/pins-and-context.md`, read against the hub and every model file it points to.
- All files in `docs/srs/`, `invariants.md` included, and all `features/*.feature`.
- Every requirement id my file cites. Each says what my file says.
- The hub relations that name my concepts. They agree.
- I1, I2, I3, I9 and I10 as they bear on my concepts. They read consistently with the model and the requirements.
- My file itself has no internal contradiction and defines each concept once.

Text marked "(open: OQ-39/40/41)" was not treated as a finding.

### Needs fixing (SRS or scenarios)

1. **Qualifying pin – PIN-01's list of sources is too short.**

  - Where: `docs/srs/05-functional-requirements.md:62`.
  - PIN-01 says qualifying pins come "only from a principal (`cairn pin add` at a principal surface, its configuration or its stamp)".
  - The list leaves out the intent and pin-candidate confirmation. The intent is set by `cairn intent set|revise`, and PIN-06's scenario refuses `cairn pin add --type intent`. Confirmation is `cairn pin-candidate confirm`.
  - Read literally, it contradicts PIN-05, PIN-06, LANE-20, LANE-26 and the model's Pin entry.

2. **Pin candidate – PIN-05's "in automation deployment mode" opens a loophole.**

  - Where: `05-functional-requirements.md:66`, quoting "never by configuration in `automation` deployment mode".
  - The qualifier implies configuration could confirm a pin candidate in `interactive` mode. LANE-26 and the model make confirmation only "its own widening principal act".
  - The scenario row at `features/pins.feature:72` tests automation mode only. That mode detects no candidates, so the row proves nothing.

3. **Qualifying pin – PEER-06's access token carries too little.**

  - Where: `docs/srs/05d-peer-requirements.md:22` and `features/peer.feature:68`.
  - The access token carries "qualifying pins … as signed events keeping their provenance (… `assistant` for a run seat's)".
  - A run seat's pin qualifies only through a stamp, and an edited pin restores its newest version. Neither the stamp events nor the edit events are carried, so the ephemeral node cannot work out what qualifies.

4. **Directed post – no interface writes one.**

  - LANE-12 (`05b-lane-requirements.md:24`) needs directed posts.
  - `room_post` (`09-interfaces.md:57`) and `cairn room post` (`09a-command-line-interface.md:56`) have no target-agent parameter.
  - That breaks VIEW-03 (`05b-room-view-requirements.md:40`): everything the room view lets a person do must also exist in the CLI or MCP.

5. **Summary request – the scenario caps something the SRS does not.**

  - Where: `features/lane.feature:515-516`, which caps the summary request itself at 500.
  - LANE-33, §9.2 (`09-interfaces.md:73-74`) and §9.6 (`:175`) cap only `room_summary_get`.

6. **Budget – the step budget is called a "limit".**

  - Where: CMP-05 (`05-functional-requirements.md:124`) says "Exceeding a limit". The scenario (`features/kernel.feature:56-69`) produces "step budget limit".
  - This merges the step budget into the limits, which the model's Budget entry keeps apart.

7. **Budget – §8.4 renames the restore block limit.**

  - Where: `docs/srs/08-data-and-storage.md:57`.
  - It calls INJ-07's restore block limit one of the "model-token caps".

8. **Working view – "the view" is ambiguous.**

  - Where: `docs/srs/03-rationale.md:13`, "Keep the record separate from the view."
  - "The view" is unqualified and can be read as the room view.

9. **Pin – "pins" used in a non-Cairn sense.**

  - Where: `features/engineering.feature:11,13`, "the toolchain is pinned …", "pins the Go toolchain".
  - The step is bound at `cmd/cairn/bdd_engineering_test.go:40`, so the binding must change too.
  - The same title's "stamped" belongs to the acts-and-roles specialist.
  - ENG-01 itself avoids the word ("fixed to an exact version").

10. **Model reply and compaction summary – a scenario title coins its own terms.**

  - Where: `features/provenance.feature:85`.
  - "model-reproducible text" and "harness-summarised text" stand in for the model's terms "model reply" and `harness_text`.
  - The examples include system reminders and a restore block written back, which are not summaries.

### Questions for the stakeholder

11. **Working view is never used.** The SRS says "the model's context" or "an agent's context" instead, for example in LANE-24, LANE-30, VIEW-15, VIEW-17 and OWN-25. Should those places say "working view", or should the model note that those phrases stand for the working view?
12. **Qualifying pin under INJ-05.** "Qualifying pin" is defined per run: the rooms the run has had a seat in. INJ-05 (`05-functional-requirements.md:109`) injects "qualifying pins only" when the run is ambiguous, so it is undefined which rooms' pins go in. Over-injecting would break PIN-10's "to runs that have had a seat in its room".

### For other specialists

- **Record (Kernel):** `03-rationale.md:31` reads "Kernel (§5.8)". The kernel is §5.7; §5.8 is Administration.
- **Acts and roles (Stamp):** "stamped" at `engineering.feature:11` (see item 9).

### Instruction feedback

- My instructions name the SRS and scenarios but say nothing about step bindings in `cmd/cairn/bdd_*_test.go`. Saying that a scenario wording fix must also cover its binding would help.
- They don't say how to treat the model's own words appearing in plain-English or outside senses ("pinned toolchain", "the model's context") when the hub's exemption for engineering tooling doesn't clearly cover scenario files. A rule would help.
- They don't say how to judge a concept the model defines but the SRS never uses ("working view"). I raised it as a question; a stated policy would help.
