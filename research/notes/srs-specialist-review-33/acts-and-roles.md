I found four defects in the SRS and scenarios that need fixing, and three gaps in my own file, acts-and-roles.md, which need a stakeholder ruling. None needs new invariant wording.

**Defects to fix**

1. **Joined run seats are assumed to have work.** The LANE-01 and LMK-01 scenarios route a joined run's events to its seat in the room without any role assignment.

  - Role says a seat with no role assignment or appointment is a viewer, apart from the owner's device seats, a run's personal-room seat and a run's seat in a room it created.
  - LANE-16 says "No role MAY follow from joining", and a viewer has no work.
  - As written, both scenarios cannot pass: the events would go to the personal-room seat. lane.feature:17 also implies the default role is something other than viewer.
  - Fix: add an invite or role assignment that gives the joined seat the contributor role.

2. **LANE-19 uses "concurrently" in a sense the model does not define.** It says "When two subagents edit the same file concurrently". In the model, Concurrent means neither event is causally after the other.

  - Two subagents on one node write to writers that record each other's heads, so their edits are almost never concurrent in that sense. The Needs you item would then never fire.
  - What LANE-19 means is that the two edits overlap in time.

3. **"Concurrent" is used for things happening at the same time** in NFR-05, NFR-08, NFR-09, OWN-23, §10's soak test, the M5 pilot text and four scenarios. That gives the word a second meaning beside the model's.

  - The model's own Delegation grant entry already says "how many delegates at once", where OWN-23 says "maximum concurrent delegates".
  - Fix: use "at once" or "in parallel". The SQLite-specific uses (S2's "WAL concurrency", ADR-07's "concurrent connections") belong to SQLite and can stay.

4. **LANE-17 and LANE-16 ask the room view to show every seat's role.** The owner's device seats have no role, and nor does a paired phone's personal-room seat. LANE-22 already handles this with "role, or owner". The principals-and-agents specialist shares this, since Owner is defined there.

**Gaps in my own file, for the stakeholder**

5. **Room merge's coverage list leaves out branch links**, although the same entry gives their conflict rule. LANE-01 also says branch links resolve under LANE-31.
6. **The owner's own runs that join the owner's room default to viewer**, so their events never route there.

  - LANE-16 gives the owner's agents' run seats "only their role and any appointment", and no role follows from joining.
  - A seat id exists only after the join, so the owner would have to assign a role after every join, or invite its own key.
  - Should such a seat get contributor, as a run's seat in a room it created does?

7. **Capability is defined as "What a role lets a seat do".** But the owner's device seats have every capability without a role, and writing a room summary comes from the facilitator's appointment.

**Checked and found consistent**

- The cut, neutral and widening lists match every principal act a requirement names: OWN-11's examples, the class each §9.5 CLI row states, PEER-01/05/06/08/10/11, SEC-12/27/28/30, ADM-02/04/06, LANE-02/10/11/12/13/15/17/18/20/23/26/32, VIEW-11/13, OWN-05/07/13/16/18/21/22/23/25/26/27/28/29 and §9.7.4.
- Expire acts agree with LANE-25, PEER-05, OWN-23 and OWN-26, including that only a grant may set an expiry before PRV-10 ships.
- How the hub routes room, principal and expire acts agrees with LANE-01, OWN-02, OWN-17, §4.3 and §9.5. Join agrees with LANE-23.
- Roles and capabilities agree with LANE-16 and §9.2. Appointments agree with LANE-16 and SEC-32. Bars, kicks and mutes agree with LANE-25 and SEC-32. Pick order agrees with VIEW-22 and LANE-31.
- Handover, succession and stamps agree with LANE-11 and LANE-32. The review step agrees with LANE-10 and SEC-26.
- I2 and I10 read the same in my file, invariants.md and the requirements, including "a pin version that principal stamped", "room state" and "active pins".
- None of the excluded words that map to my concepts appear outside history: operator as a role, owner act, participant, player, read only as a seat state, judge.
- Every requirement id my file cites exists and says what my file says. OQ-41's mark matches where it is used.

Instruction feedback:

- My instructions don't say whether an ordinary-English use of a word my file defines counts as a finding, such as "concurrent" applied to runs and processes. The hub's one-meaning rule suggests it does; a sentence saying so would help.
- Step 3 asks me to search for "any word the hub excludes in its favour", but the exclusion table doesn't say which entries point to which file. A short mapping would help, for example operator to moderator, read only to mute, participant to seat.
- My instructions don't say how to treat scenarios that leave out a precondition one of my concepts decides, such as a role default. I reported them as needs-fix.
