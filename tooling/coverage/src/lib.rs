//! Measures line coverage of the workspace per test layer (unit,
//! integration and end-to-end) and per crate, and holds each crate to
//! the floors in `[workspace.metadata.coverage]` (ENG-11). It runs
//! cargo-llvm-cov once per test layer over one instrumented build, so
//! each layer's number counts only what that layer's tests ran, and
//! adds the layers up for the whole. It is repository tooling and never
//! links into a shipped executable.
