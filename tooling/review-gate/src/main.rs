//! The `review-gate` command decides the review the reviewer app posts
//! on a pull request (ENG-28). The review workflow runs it from main's
//! copy of the repository, in the one job that holds the app's key,
//! after the reviewing agent wrote its review outcome. It prints the
//! review as the JSON GitHub's create-review endpoint takes, prints
//! nothing when the pull request moved past the reviewed head, and
//! exits non-zero on anything it cannot decide, so the job fails and
//! posts nothing.
//!
//! It reads files and writes stdout only; the workflow fetches the
//! check runs and posts the review. It is CI tooling and never ships.
