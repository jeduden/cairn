# Cairn's pitch and direction

The working pitch, the stakeholder's decisions behind it, and how it
got here. The SRS change this plan ends in turns it into the contract;
until then it is direction, not requirement.

## Pitch v12: for the developer (4 October 2026)

Written for developers: their day first, then what Cairn changes.
Items marked "next" are P2 in the SRS. Revised through three loops of
blind persona review ([round 10](persona-review/round-10/README.md)),
then cut to a third of its length and set against dots, Amp orbs and
Buzz in a blind preference panel
([round 11](persona-review/round-11/README.md)); the detail the reviews
asked for lives in the concepts and the requirements.

### Cairn: from intent to outcome

Multiplayer for you and your agents. Say what you want, watch them
work, keep what you got or correct course.

**You know this.** Five agents is already a lot. One waits on a prompt
in a lost tab, another forgot your rule after compaction, a third says
"all tests pass" and you dig through logs to check. Two edited the same
file. The pull request says nothing of how the code came to be.

**With Cairn,** every intent gets a room. Install the plugin; your
harness, terminal and settings stay as they are. Your rooms on the
left, ranked by what needs you. In the middle, one conversation with
every agent on the intent. On the right, whatever an agent presents:
the running app, the diff, the test run. Or follow an agent and watch
its file change as it edits. All of it works in the terminal too.

**Say it once.** Pin the goal and your rules. They come back to your
agents word for word after every compaction.

**Try it several ways.** Each attempt is a branch in the room; compare
them side by side.

**Keep it or correct course.** Click through to the lines and the runs
behind an outcome. Commit and land it on your forge as always, or pin a
correction every agent takes.

**Point, link, find.** Mark any line, sentence or screenshot region and
get a link. Every commit links back to its room. Search finds the exact
moment; agents recall it the same way, marked as untrusted data.

**Rooms talk.** The API room posts to the frontend room. Its agents
read it when they look; it instructs them only if you say so.

**Back on Monday?** Each room says what changed, what failed and what
waits for you, with every gap flagged.

**Safe by default.** Nothing leaves your machine until you share, and
secrets are redacted before anything is written. Agents take
instructions only from you and those you trust by key; everything else
is untrusted data. Next: your machines and teammates share rooms peer
to peer, offline-first, with no central service.

## Pitch v9 (3 October 2026, after three persona reviews)

> Cairn: know exactly what your agents did, and work with them live.
>
> Agents now work around the clock, in parallel, across machines. Cairn
> keeps the full, hash-chained record of each lane of work (every
> message, edit, tool run and result) on your own machines, with
> secrets redacted before anything is written, and tells you when any
> of it is missing or changed. Your standing rules are
> pinned: they come back word for word after every compaction, and
> your agents recall exactly what they did whenever they ask.
>
> One view shows each agent as it works, what it produced, and what
> verified it: the agent's own claim or a run on its own machine; next,
> a reviewer's re-run or CI for that exact commit.
>
> It runs standalone: nothing leaves your machine except what your
> agent recalls into its own model call. Next, turn on peer to peer to
> work a lane live with others, with no central service and no break
> when the network splits. Also next: hand a maintainer a lane as a
> reviewed, signed bundle, a plain file with no account or peering.
>
> Others can then post to your lane; only you decide what becomes an
> instruction to your agents. Endorsing a post sends exactly what you
> saw, signed as yours. Otherwise their words, like tool output and web
> pages, reach your agents only when the agents ask, marked untrusted.

What the requirement traces changed in the pitch, and why:

| Pitch change                                                                                      | Reason from the SRS                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Added pinned rules restored word for word, and exact recall                                       | I3 and RCL-03 are the SRS's core value and its strongest measured result; the pitch had dropped them                                      |
| Added redaction before anything is written                                                        | SEC-08 redacts before storage; the security officer and maintainer personas need it                                                       |
| "Reach agents only when they ask" instead of "reach them as untrusted data"                       | I2 has two halves, the label and the asking; the pitch kept only the label                                                                |
| "Others can post; only you decide what becomes an instruction" instead of "only you can instruct" | PRV-04 makes automation the default, where even the owner is untrusted; a principal endorses a post to their own agents as a recorded act |
| Tool output and web pages named as untrusted too                                                  | I2 covers all content outside the trusted boundary, not only other people                                                                 |
| "Nothing leaves your machine except what your agent recalls"                                      | I4 itself lets recalled content travel to the model provider                                                                              |
| "What verified it: the agent's claim or its own run; re-runs and CI next"                         | No requirement covered verification; LANE-05 gives each result one evidence class                                                         |
| "Tells you when any of it is missing"; re-runs and CI marked next                                 | Persona reviews: VIEW-08 and REC-19 report gaps; witness runs and CI attestation are P2 (LANE-05, SEC-28)                                 |
| "Endorsing a post sends exactly what you saw"                                                     | D2 and OWN-08: a principal's endorsement is the one path from another person's words to an agent                                          |
| Peer to peer is "next"                                                                            | Peering is P2 work after the standalone release; NG4 excludes it from v1                                                                  |

The lane is the unit: a branch, its worktrees, its agents and humans,
and their conversations and results. That is a pull request in all but
its interface. Git keeps the code; Cairn keeps the lane.

## The stakeholder's decisions

1. Keep the name Cairn.
2. The lane, a live pull request, is the unit Cairn holds.
3. No dependence on a central service. Self-hosting is normal, as it
   is for git.
4. Standalone works with no network at all. Peer to peer extends it.
5. Multiplayer works without a central server, through partitions;
   CRDTs and other conflict resolution handle the merge.
6. The user experience comes first; making sync seamless is the second
   step.
7. Security must be good enough, measured against Zed Delta.
8. There is a UI. One view shows an agent's harness live, its work
   results and the other harnesses. Harnesses also connect directly;
   the UI is one more client, never a required hop.
9. The standalone UI is a web page in the browser on a loopback-only
   port. Standalone means Cairn sends nothing off the machine.
10. Network boundaries are defined explicitly: process, machine, peer
    and public. See
    [plan 2610022338](../2610022338_cairn-network-side/plan.md).
11. Judging happens beside the chat: the lane view shows the outcome
    live (the running app from the dev server, the diff, the files the
    harness produced, the test runs). The outcome pane is table stakes:
    all of it, the running-app preview included, ships in the first
    release (4 October 2026). What sets Cairn apart is judging against
    the intent and correcting in place. This informs OQ-30.

## Direction compared with Zed Delta

Zed Delta is the closest product: public beta since 16 September 2026,
"Replacing pull requests". Sources are in the
[review](../../research/notes/live-pr-pitch-review/competitors.md). T3
Code competes with the standalone lane view today: a local GUI that
drives several harnesses, with diffs, checkpoints and in-app review, but
one agent per thread and one person per environment. It is read from its
source in the [T3 Code note](../../research/notes/t3code/t3code.md). Amp's
orbs run agents on its remote machines and add agent-to-agent messaging
and multiplayer threads, all on Amp's service, with no documented trust
boundary ([Amp orbs note](../../research/notes/amp-orbs/amp-orbs.md)).
How their screens, and Claude Code on the web, lay out the work is
compared in the [agent UX note](../../research/notes/agent-ux/agent-ux.md).
Cloudflare's Artifacts (1 October 2026) offers a hosted, git-compatible
store for "hundreds, or even thousands, of agents", a fork per task,
and asks what the next GitHub looks like; it states no trust model
([Artifacts note][cf]).

## Lessons from OpenAI dots

From [the dots notes](../../research/notes/openai-agent-ui/dots.md):
the question of the moment is "what did my agent do?", which Cairn's
record answers; a completed run is not a verified one, so results show
what checked them; rule levels per action shape the owner's control.

## How the pitch changed

1. A lossless, secure memory for one agent.
2. Session history next to git, shared across a fleet.
3. The live pull request: the lane as one record.
4. After a blind adversarial review
   ([notes](../../research/notes/live-pr-pitch-review/)): lead with
   security, since Delta owns the live-PR headline; add the process a
   pull request runs; stop claiming that code and talk "never drift".
5. Standalone first, peer to peer second, a UI over harnesses.
6. After OpenAI dots: lead with knowing what your agents did.
7. After the requirement traces
   ([forward](trace-forward.md), [backward](trace-backward.md)): restore
   pinning, recall and redaction; keep I2's asking half; scope owner
   trust and "nothing leaves the machine" to what the SRS can hold.
8. After the persona reviews ([persona-review](persona-review/README.md)):
   say what is missing, mark re-runs, CI and the gate as next, and name
   endorsement as the way another person's words reach an agent.
9. For developers: open with the day they already have (tabs,
   compaction, the unexplained diff, the review without its story),
   then what Cairn changes; add reviewing the outcome, delegation and
   lane sharing; half the words of v9. The stakeholder named the
   process Cairn must excel at: intent to outcome. The pitch now
   follows that loop: state the intent, watch, judge the outcome,
   correct course, with several judges on top. A person judges; Cairn
   never does.
10. The developer's experience step by step, in the harness and the
    lane view; "harness" where the harness is meant; "git keeps the
    code" dropped.
11. The lane view leads: chat and live outcome side by side (the
    running app, the diff, the files, the test runs), and the person
    judges and corrects right there.
12. After the blind review ([round 8](persona-review/round-8/README.md)):
    the pitch is for the developer with a lot of agents. Fleet framing,
    pinned rules beside the intent, catch-up, the install contract, the
    terminal as an equal surface, overlap warnings, a clear retry, and a
    plain statement of what Cairn connects to.
13. The tooling must let one developer run a hundred agents: the view
    shows only what needs the person, ranked, and delegation runs
    within a granted budget.
14. A hundred agents work on about ten intents. The intent, not the
    agent or the lane, is what the person sees, judges and corrects; an
    intent may hold several lanes and parallel attempts.
15. The target is a team: four people, ten intents, a hundred agents.
    Teammates judge, correct and collide inside the main story, not in
    a footnote; sharing still arrives after the single-developer
    release.
16. Start from today: nobody runs a hundred agents, because the
    tooling does not exist; five agents on five intents is already a
    lot. The pitch opens there and promises growth: delegation, judging
    by intent, then the team. The hundred agents and the team of four
    stay the direction, not the opening.
17. Cairn's screen leads: intents on the left, the chat in the middle,
    the live outcome on the right, the intent and its criteria on top.
    The terminal is the alternative, not the frame.
18. The middle is a room per intent, not a chat with one agent: the
    person talks to every agent on the intent at once, each agent's work
    appears under its name, and agents take orders only from the
    person.
19. Seeing what the agents do, not only the outcome: follow an agent
    and the file view shows the file it is editing as the edit happens,
    and the command it runs as it runs. This is multiplayer: the person
    and their agents are the players from the first release; teammates
    join the same room later, and every player can be followed.
20. After the [agent UX note](../../research/notes/agent-ux/agent-ux.md):
    the three-pane screen and a live preview are table stakes; pointing
    at an element or a line carries into the correction. Tools for the
    agent to present its outcome per criterion, recorded evidence, one
    ranked queue and a room of agents are what none of them do.
21. Presenting the outcome against the criteria is the agent's job,
    done with tools the UI offers; Cairn marks which evidence it
    recorded, and the person judges.
22. One primitive for pointing: mark text in the room, lines in a diff
    or log, or a region of an image, and get a link to exactly that,
    as pull requests link lines but extended to images. People and
    agents use the links in the discussion, the correction and the
    presentation of an outcome.
23. v11: rewritten from scratch around everything since v9, in a third fewer
    words than the last v10 draft (git history holds v10).
24. v11 corrected: no compaction promise for rooms until pinning has a
    model; any player links, not only agents; the recorded-versus-claim
    line dropped; retry left out until it works with several players;
    Cairn controls what it delivers to an agent, not what sways it.
25. Messages between rooms: a player in one room posts to another,
    with links; agents there read it when they look, and it instructs
    them only when the person passes it on.
26. Restoring pins is part of the room protocol (join, participate,
    leave), so the pitch again promises rules kept through every
    compaction.
27. Room pins are information agents must be aware of, not
    instructions; a room bot the owner or operator runs enforces them,
    and I2 stays as it was.
28. v12, for the room model: rooms per intent, the outcome window,
    attempts as branches, keep it or correct course in place of
    verdicts, commits that link to their room, search and exact recall,
    automations within a budget. Three loops of blind persona review
    ([round 10](persona-review/round-10/README.md)) added: only your
    pins come back as rules; notices carry no text; recall wrapped as
    untrusted; runs as the hook recorded them; the terminal beside the
    browser; stop where the harness allows it; integrity and gaps named.
29. v12 cut to 300 words at the stakeholder's request: one sentence per
    idea; the review's precision moves to the requirements.
30. A blind panel ranked it against the launch pitches of dots, Amp
    orbs and Buzz ([round 11](persona-review/round-11/README.md)):
    first for eight of nine seats. Adjusted from their notes: your
    setup stays as it is, the forge still lands code, recall is marked
    untrusted, a Monday catch-up line, redaction, trust by key, peers
    offline-first.
31. The stakeholder accepted the 355-word v12 as good enough
    (4 October 2026).

## Open before the SRS change

The reconciled [proposal](proposal.md) answers the items once listed
here: I4 by boundary and SEC-01 (§3), NG5 (§3.3), endorsement (D2,
OWN-08) and keyed commitments (REC-17). What stays open is in its §12.

Open from pitch v11, now answered:

- **Pinning in a room.** Settled by the room protocol in the
  [entity model](entity-model.md): an agent gets the intent and its
  person's pins on joining, keeps them through every compaction, and
  gets each change at its next turn. The [room protocol deep
  dive](room-protocol.md) holds harness support and nine decisions.
- **Retry with several players.** Answered by the room model: a retry
  is a new attempt, a branch in the same room from an earlier commit,
  presented beside the others ([concepts](concepts.md)).
