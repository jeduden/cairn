# Cairn for agent fleets: the reconciled proposal

This proposal drove plan 2610012322's SRS change, which has landed
as SRS 2.0-draft. Where a section landed, it now points at the SRS,
the only source; what stays here is the reasoning and the findings.
It was the one canonical proposal for that change. It
replaces the forward and backward traces, the four UX drafts and the
persona review as the source the SRS change is written from. Those
files stay as evidence. Nothing here is normative until the
stakeholder approves it and a named human security reviewer accepts
the invariant changes in §3 (ENG-29).

Sources reconciled: [pitch.md](pitch.md), [plan.md](plan.md),
[phase-1.md](phase-1.md), [trace-forward.md](trace-forward.md),
[trace-backward.md](trace-backward.md), the four drafts under `ux/`,
the persona review under `persona-review/`, plan
[2610022338](../2610022338_cairn-network-side/plan.md) with its
[phase 1](../2610022338_cairn-network-side/phase-1.md), and the SRS
1.4-draft under [docs/srs](../../docs/srs/index.md).

## 1. Summary

Cairn holds the lane: a branch, its worktrees, its agents and people,
and their conversations, edits, tool runs and results, as one
hash-chained record per writer on the user's own machines, which
shows tampering by anyone but a process of the same user until a
receipt leaves the machine. The
agent recalls it exactly; the person sees it live in one view and
steers through the harness. Peering extends it later, with no central
service.

What this proposal settles:

- **One contract version.** The SRS goes to 2.0-draft. I1, I2, I4,
  I5, I8 and I10 change wording (§3); each change waits for the named
  security reviewer, the stakeholder (@jeduden), to record approval in
  an ADR (ENG-29).
- **One id set.** 106 new requirements and 22 changed ones, numbered
  from the next free id on disk, avoiding every id another open pull
  request holds (§6, §9).
- **Four new families, chosen once.** LANE (what a lane is and what
  it derives), VIEW (what a person reads, on any surface), OWN (every
  act by which a person reaches an agent) and PEER (replication, P2).
  The traces' UI family becomes VIEW; boundary controls stay in SEC.
- **One rule per contested question** (§6.0): trust by local writer or
  certified owner device, never by claimed origin; content committed
  through a per-event key; recall defaulting to the session; every
  owner act `operator`.
- **v1 scope.** The record, pins, recall, the per-writer identity
  model and the standalone lane view with steering. Peering, the
  merge gate, public lanes and bridges are P2, specified now so v1
  does not preclude them.
- **Every persona finding dispositioned** (§10): 121 items from the
  first review, 2 not adopted, 4 adopted in part, each with its
  reason; the second review's 18 merged findings, R1–R18 (§10.12);
  the third review's 17, R3-1 to R3-17 (§10.13); the fourth review's
  8, R4-1 to R4-8 (§10.14); the fifth review's 6, R5-1 to R5-6
  (§10.15); the sixth review's 6, R6-1 to R6-6 (§10.16); the seventh
  review's 5, R7-1 to R7-5 (§10.17); and the stakeholder's OQ-29
  decision (§10.18), and the decisions on D1 to D7 (§10.19).

## 2. Defaults applied

The stakeholder decided six of these seven questions on 3 October 2026
(§10.19); D7 stays open for a longer discussion. Requirement rows
that implement one carry its tag, for example `(D4)`, at the start of
their text.

| D1  | DECIDED. I4 is restated by network boundary: B0 core, no sockets; B1 machine, loopback only; B2 peer, opt-in; B3 public, opt-in. Managed policy can disable each of B1–B3. The record becomes one signed, hash-chained log per writer, addressed by (writer, seq). The requirements name no technology: formats, storage engines and hash, commitment and signature algorithms are chosen by ADR (ENG-26). The SRS goes to 2.0-draft, and the invariant changes wait for the named security reviewer's recorded approval (ENG-29).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Keep I4 as written and ship the UI and the network side as a separate product with its own SRS.                                            | §3, SEC-01, SEC-19, SEC-22, REC-06, REC-10, REC-18, ENG-29 |
| D2  | DECIDED, with the granted-role alternative kept for later (OQ-14, behind its own I2 review). Each agent has exactly one principal; co-authors drive their own agents in the lane. Any principal forwards a post to their own agents with a signed one-click Endorse that sends exactly the text shown inside a fixed template naming its source, recorded as their act. No automatic notices by default; an opt-in notice is `TrustedText` built only from a count, key fingerprints and recall addresses, audited, and never starts a turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | A granted role that makes a co-author's messages trusted, which changes PRV-05 and needs its own I2 review; notices on by default.         | OWN-01, OWN-08, OWN-09, INJ-10, LANE-10, LANE-12           |
| D3  | DECIDED. An owner key certifies device keys, each with a scope and a maximum rule level, under an I2-reviewed requirement. A phone may only allow or deny held permission requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Every imported event untrusted, including the owner's own other devices, so a phone or second machine cannot answer anything.              | PRV-02, PRV-10, OWN-16, OWN-17, PEER-07                    |
| D4  | DECIDED, with OQ-17 answered yes: a permission decision computed from the owner's signed rules may return through a hook with a fixed template. Cairn never denies on a timeout unless the owner turned on an away policy, and the harness's own prompt stays answerable while Cairn holds a request. Holds get their own NFR-01 budget row. `cairn run` is a separate, optional launcher outside the core, with its own boundary row and review. Plain-hook Claude Code gets reduced controls, stated at install. Owner steering, approvals and replies reach an agent only through the harness's own input, never through hook output, and carry only owner-typed text or fixed templates that reference ids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | A 3-minute hold that parks and denies by default; steering through hook output; no launcher, so plain hooks are the only Claude Code path. | OWN-03..07, OWN-15, OWN-19, NFR-01, SEC-29                 |
| D5  | DECIDED by the stakeholder (3 October 2026, OQ-29). Against an unsandboxed agent of the same user, no software surface proves who acted, so Cairn rests owner acts on the sandbox around the agent (plan 2610031222) and does not try to defeat an unsandboxed one. Owner acts fall in three classes; cut and neutral acts need only an authenticated surface or a terminal. Widening acts need only the same while every session on the node runs in a sandbox that blocks the residual risks; while any session leaves a risk open, they need the owner's recorded acceptance of the open risks (OWN-22), and Cairn labels every such session. WebAuthn per act stays available as hardening that the owner or managed policy may require. With only the core, the person also acts through the harness's own channels (its prompt, `/pin` and `/unpin` scoped to the session, typing to it), which Cairn records but does not vouch for. | Presence optional, so an unsandboxed same-user agent's only obstacle is the launch credential and the CLI code.                            | OWN-11, OWN-12, LANE-11                                    |
| D6  | DECIDED. Search scope is a choice: on every search the person selects session, lane, project or every lane the tenant holds, and the surface shows the scope it used. An agent selects its own scope through RCL-05's explicit `scope` parameter, defaulting to the session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Operator search scoped like agent recall, one project at a time.                                                                           | VIEW-09, RCL-05                                            |
| D7  | OPEN: deferred by the stakeholder for a longer discussion; rows tagged (D7) keep a provisional priority until then. The default under discussion: The standalone lane view is P1 in v1. Peering is P2, specified now so v1 does not preclude it. Whatever D7 decides for the browser view, the CLI forms of Catch up, search, verify and the gap display (VIEW-08..11) stay P1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The view moves to P2 after v1.0; its P1 rows become P2 unchanged. Or the view becomes P0, which delays v1 by a milestone.                  | VIEW, OWN, NG4, NG5, §11                                   |

D4 includes OQ-17, answered yes by the stakeholder: a permission decision
(allow, ask, deny) computed from the owner's signed rules is harness
control, not text, so a hook may return it with a fixed template that
references ids (OWN-04). Owner-typed text never goes through a hook.

## 3. Invariant and constraint changes

Every change in this section needs a human security review and is the
reason the SRS becomes 2.0-draft (CLAUDE.md, §1.3). Each row is
flagged **SECURITY REVIEW**. ENG-29 makes the review a gate: no
component that crosses B0 is built past a prototype, and no row below
is accepted, until an ADR records the named reviewer's approval.

Unchanged in wording: I3 (pin scope in PIN-10 narrows where a pin is
restored, never what it says), I6 (it now binds every binary, OPS-06),
I7 (SEC-22 and SEC-23 tighten it) and I9. A hold is the owner's
policy, bounded by its own NFR-01 row, not a Cairn failure; a Cairn
failure during a hold still falls back to the harness's prompt
(OWN-06).

The backward trace's separate I11 ("network boundaries are explicit")
is not adopted: it would split one concern across two invariants, and
D1 restates I4 instead.

### 6.0 One rule per contested question

1. **Trust by local writer or certified device, never by claimed
   origin.** The forward trace trusted by origin; the backward trace
   trusted nothing imported. Rule: an event is trusted only if this
   node's own writer wrote it in a class PRV-02 trusts, or it is an
   `operator` event signed by a device key this tenant's owner key
   certified, within that key's scope and rule level (PRV-02, PRV-10).
   Every other imported event is untrusted, whatever its class. The
   writer comes from the verified key alone, and an import claiming a
   local writer is refused (PRV-09). Reason: "nothing imported" leaves
   the owner's phone and second machine powerless (D3), while trust by
   claimed origin lets any peer forge it; a certified, scoped key is
   the narrowest rule that serves both.
2. **Per-event keyed commitment, not tenant-keyed or lane-keyed
   hashing.** The traces disagreed on the key. Rule: content enters
   the chain, seals, tombstones and anything replicated only as a
   keyed commitment to the content under `k_e`, where `k_e` is drawn
   per event, stored with the content and erased with it (REC-17).
   Local file and directory names use a tenant-local storage key that
   never leaves the node (REC-09, LANE-02). Reason: a tenant key
   cannot be shared with co-authors' nodes, so they could not check
   content; a lane key is shared by every holder, so any holder could
   confirm a guess at purged content from the retained commitment.
   Only a key erased with the content meets "no retained or replicated
   value confirms purged content".
3. **Recall defaults to the session; lane and project are explicit.**
   Rule: RCL-05 keeps the current session as the default, adds an
   explicit, logged `lane` and `project` scope, puts foreign lanes
   outside every widened scope (RCL-10), and keeps cross-project
   recall out of v1. Reason: a lane-wide default widens what every
   agent reads, and recall taint (SEC-13) with it, for no request of
   the agent's; the explicit scope gives lane work to agents that ask.
4. **Every owner act is `operator`.** The UX drafts gave owner acts
   `user`, `operator` or `harness_meta`. Rule: every owner act the
   glossary lists, written by an authenticated owner surface, is
   `operator` (OWN-02). A prompt typed into the harness stays `user`,
   trusted only in interactive mode (PRV-04). An answer given at the
   harness's own prompt is recorded as `harness_meta`: an outcome, not
   an act. A post is `post`, always untrusted. Reason: one class per
   kind of proof; `user` cannot carry the owner's authority because
   automation mode distrusts it, and an outcome the harness reports
   proves nothing about who answered.

A tenant- or project-configuration change that adds or ends a pin, changes the deployment mode, loosens redaction, recall scope, rule levels or holds, or turns on a B1–B3 component MUST take effect only after a widening act under OWN-11 records its digest, or when managed policy sets it.                             | T    | I6, I7  | U1, U8     |

### 6.2 The requirement tables

Sections 6.2 to 6.14 drafted the requirement rows. They landed, and were
revised since, in [§5](../../docs/srs/05-functional-requirements.md),
[§5b](../../docs/srs/05b-lane-requirements.md),
[§5c](../../docs/srs/05c-owner-and-peer-requirements.md),
[§6](../../docs/srs/06-security.md),
[§7](../../docs/srs/07-non-functional-requirements.md),
[§9](../../docs/srs/09-interfaces.md) and
[§10](../../docs/srs/10-engineering-quality.md); the SRS is the only
source.

## 7. Boundary register

Landed in [§6.3 Boundary register](../../docs/srs/06-security.md).

## 8. Unified UX vocabulary

Landed in [§9b](../../docs/srs/09b-lane-vocabulary.md).

## 9. Id mapping table

"—" means the trace proposed nothing there. New ids start from the next
free number on disk and skip ASM-10..16, PRV-08, OQ-10..13, T10..T13
and the CUE family.

Not adopted: the maintainer's ask that their journeys work in v1
(maintainer, round 2, finding 4). Import of a stranger's bundle is the
widest new input path, so REC-23, LANE-15 and SEC-26 stay P2 behind
their own proposal and ADR; the pitch names them as next.

### 10.18 The stakeholder's OQ-29 decision

On 3 October 2026 the stakeholder put sandboxing on its own arm, plan
2610031222, and decided that for an unsandboxed session the residual
risks are accepted rather than fought. The proposal follows:

- D5 is decided: owner acts rest on the sandbox; widening acts need
  only an authenticated surface while every session blocks the
  residual risks, and the owner's recorded acceptance otherwise.
- OWN-22 is new: the sandbox state of each session, from a source the
  agent cannot write, and the risk acceptance, which managed policy
  may forbid.
- OWN-11, OWN-12, OWN-16, PRV-02, SEC-20 and SEC-22 drop the mandatory
  per-act WebAuthn assertion; it stays as hardening the owner or
  managed policy may require, with the enrolment rules of round 6.
- Rounds 4 to 7 of the persona review stand as the analysis behind the
  decision: they established that no software-only check holds against
  an unsandboxed agent.

### 10.19 The stakeholder's decisions on D1 to D7

| D1, record      | One signed log per writer; the requirements name no technology, and ADRs choose formats and algorithms                              |
| D2              | One principal per agent, endorsement, notices off; granted roles later (OQ-14)                                                      |
| D3              | An owner key certifies device keys; the phone only allows once or denies                                                            |
| D4              | No deny on a timeout without an away policy; steering through the harness's input; OQ-17 yes                                        |
| D5              | Decided earlier through OQ-29 (§10.18)                                                                                              |
| D6              | Search scope is the person's choice on every search; an agent selects its own under RCL-05                                          |
| D7              | Open, for a longer discussion                                                                                                       |
| ENG-29 reviewer | The stakeholder, @jeduden                                                                                                           |
| D1, packaging   | Not decided: boundaries hold per component and per process, so one executable or several both fit (ADR-2610032155, change 3; OQ-32) |

The packaging answer came during the security review: a process runs
exactly one component, no core process starts another, and the
boundaries hold whether the components behind B1 to B3 ship in one
executable or several. Which one waits for the tech re-evaluation
(OQ-32). The rows above that still say "separate binary", or name a
mechanism, are superseded by SRS 2.0-draft's SEC-01, SEC-19, SEC-28,
SEC-29, PEER-01, CON-02, CON-04, ENG-12 and ENG-16.
