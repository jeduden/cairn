summary: >-
  Normative home layout, logical schema, canonical encoding (RFC 8785

# 8. Data and storage

Semantics in this section are normative. Table and column names are
illustrative; the implementation MAY differ as long as every constraint marked
**(N)** is met.

## 8.1 Home layout

```text
$CAIRN_HOME/                          0700, belonging to one OS user       (N)
├── config.toml                       the principal's configuration        0600
├── home.json                         home id binding (home.id, SEC-03)    0600
├── audit/audit-NNNNNN.jsonl          hash-chained audit log               0600
├── logs/                             structured logs (optional)
├── store.db  (+ -wal, -shm)          the store: record and derived artifacts, partitioned by writer  0600
├── payloads/<name>                   the store's payload store, named per REC-09  0600
└── ingest/                           ingest markers for deferred ingestion
```

A home contains one store, `store.db` with its payload store, partitioned by
writer, never by repository or room (N). Names in the home MUST NOT reveal a
repository's path or identity (N).

## 8.2 Logical schema

Purge replaces event content with nothing and keeps the row's address, `hash`,
and `prev_hash`, so the chain stays verifiable and each writer's `seq` stays
gap-free **(N)**.

## 8.3 Canonical encoding

The hash chain (REC-10) and the audit chain (OPS-02) MUST use the JSON
Canonicalization Scheme (RFC 8785) over a documented field set, with SHA-256
**(N)**. The field set and encoding version are recorded in `meta` so that
future changes remain verifiable.

## 8.4 Model-token estimation

The pin budget (PIN-08) and the model-token caps of INJ-07, RCL-03 and
CMP-06 depend on model-token counts.
Cairn MUST use a conservative estimator, calibrated in M0 against
Claude's own model-token counts, such that the estimate is greater
than or equal to the true count for at least 99% of a representative
sample **(N)**.

## 8.5 Lifecycle grid

The grid names, for each lifecycle event that ships in M1 to M5, the
requirement that decides what it does to each derived artifact I10
lists, to provenance and to room membership. An event a lifecycle event
appends is indexed, counted and shown like any other; a cell names only
what goes beyond that, and a dash means no effect. Run status (VIEW-04),
the Needs you queue (VIEW-05), evidence classes (LANE-05) and proof
classes (LANE-06) ship in M7, so their columns hold only what M1 to M5
already derive. The final review and M1's scenarios check against the
grid, and each later milestone's review adds the events it ships
(OQ-47).
