# 9.7 Room vocabulary

One vocabulary for every surface (VIEW-14): status words, marks, queue
order and keys. The reasons behind each choice are in plan 2610012322's
proposal, §8.

## 9.7.1 Run status and freshness

| Status       | Meaning                                                | Sub-labels                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Starting** | launched, no first event yet                           | —                                             |
| **Working**  | a turn is running                                      | —                                             |
| **Asking**   | waiting on its principal                               | `permission`, `question`, `hand-off`          |
| **Idle**     | turn ended, nothing pending                            | `claims done` when the agent says so (a mark) |
| **Paused**   | paused by its principal at a safe point, acknowledged  | —                                             |
| **Blocked**  | cannot proceed without something other than a decision | `rate limit`, `error`                         |
| **Ended**    | run ended, acknowledged                                | `by agent`, `by principal`, `crashed`         |

| Freshness mark | Meaning                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (none)         | live: events current on this node                                                                             |
| `behind`       | on a writer whose log has not reached this node lately: "as of 14:02 on desktop"                              |
| `unrecorded`   | the run is live but the hook handlers have seen no hook since a time                                          |
| `ingested`     | an ingested run: from a transcript the hook handlers did not watch (REC-22)                                   |
| `stuck?`       | a watchdog observation (OWN-09), computed where shown, never recorded: Working with no event past a threshold |

## 9.7.2 Room status

Room status is a derived view, never state: no act sets it directly, though
OWN-21's ready and abandoned marks feed it (LANE-09). Rooms do not land;
branches do, by git or the forge (LANE-08). First match wins, in this order:
**Abandoned** (the owner marked the room abandoned) and **Landed** (every branch
the room names has landed), **Asking** (a run waits on its principal),
**Failing** (a check failed on the head of a branch the room names, evidence
`own check` or stronger), **Blocked**, **Running**, **Ready for review** (only
after the principal act of OWN-21 marking the room ready), **Quiet** (never
while a run is `unrecorded` or `behind`, VIEW-04). The pull-request states a
forge reports (Pre-review, In review, Changes requested, Approved, Queued,
Merging) live on the pull-request pill (P2, LANE-08), marked `asserted`, not in
the room status; Cairn keeps no approval state of its own. A check's check
state is one of Pending, Executing, Passed, Failed, Stale, Unbound and Absent.
No check state shares a name with a room status, a draft or a landing.

## 9.7.3 Evidence and proof classes

| Evidence class  | Glyph | Rank (LANE-05)    |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| `claim`         | `○`   | lowest            |
| `own check`     | `◐`   | above `claim`     |
| `witness check` | `◑`   | above `own check` |
| `CI attested`   | `●`   | highest           |

| Proof class           | Counts as proven |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `same commit`         | yes              |
| `same patch`          | yes              |
| `same tree`           | yes              |
| `likely`              | no               |
| `asserted`            | no               |
| `not proven` + reason | no               |

## 9.7.4 Needs you order

Queue classes, named Q1–Q4 so they never read as priorities P0–P2: **Q1 blocking
now** (held requests: permission, question, hand-off), **Q2 blocking the room**
(failed required check, crash, rate limit with no resume, refused segment,
overlap), **Q3 waiting on you** (a pull-request review the forge asks of you, an
outcome awaiting a verdict, a role request, a directed post awaiting your
endorsement (LANE-12), a pin version you stamped that was edited, unpinned or
taken off the pin list (LANE-32), your device-seat pin a list removal took off
the pin list (LANE-26), a held request past its hold window under a keep-going
away policy (OWN-07), a quota crossed), **Q4 for your record** (never alerts).
Dismissing a directed post is a cut principal act, dismissing any other Q3 or Q4
item a neutral one, and each room's owner acknowledges an overlap for its room
(LANE-13). Order: class; inside Q1, the number of agents blocked on the same
answer, then causal order of raising; inside Q2 and Q3, rooms in the focus set
first, then causal order. The focus set changes only by a recorded neutral
principal act, so every device of the principal shows one order. Causal order,
not wall-clock age, because age differs between nodes and reads a clock (I10);
it is oldest first wherever clocks agree. Pull-request reviews the forge asks of
the principal join the same queue.

## 9.7.5 Integrity status

The integrity status of a room or a writer, shown on every surface and
in the envelope's `integrity` field (§9.3), is one of seven values
(VIEW-10): `verified` ◆ (chains and seals check), `unsigned`
(hash-chained, before REC-18 or past the newest seal), `incomplete` ◇ (a
writer's events are missing here), `unverified` (an event after a
break), `broken` ✕ (a check failed), `refused` (a segment was refused),
`equivocated` (PEER-10). The UI never says "secure".

## 9.7.6 Trust marks

No mark, for the principal's own agents, on this node's own `operator` and
structural events, the `harness_meta` events its hook handlers witnessed, and
the `user` turns they witnessed while the deployment mode is `interactive` (an
ingested one is untrusted, REC-22); on principal acts a device key the principal
certified signed, and posts and pins written from a device seat such a key
certified, within that key's scope, from any of its nodes (shown with a device
glyph); on pin versions the principal stamped (shown with the stamper, LANE-32);
and on posts and pins a trust grant of the principal covers outside a foreign
room, written from device seats a device key of the trusted principal certified,
never a token-key-only node's (shown with the granted key's petname, OWN-29).
`○` plus petname on anything untrusted from another principal, agent, node or
bundle, a `user` turn another node recorded included; a key with no petname
shows its fingerprint. `⚑` flagged (PRV-07). `▒` quarantined. `▬` from a seat
that is no longer a member: it left, was kicked or was barred. `ingested`.
`new key`. "from a revoked device". Timeline rails: solid for the agent's
principal, hollow for other principals, dotted for agents and the forge. Events
from a token-key-only node's writers are untrusted on every other node unless a
principal stamped them (PRV-02). Unsandboxed agents are one line on Health, not
a mark on every tile.

## 9.7.7 Keymap

One map, no key bound to two actions. Typing in a composer or text
field sends text, not shortcuts.

| Key                   | Action                                                | Key             | Action                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `1` / `2` / `3`       | Room page tabs: Timeline / Review / Replay            | `m`             | steer an agent with a fixed template naming this address (OWN-03)        |
| `j` / `k`             | next / previous row, item or file                     | `q`             | quarantine selection                                                     |

Interrupt moved from `Esc Esc` to `I`, so no key repeats into a second
act. Composer: `Enter` steer, `Ctrl+Enter` queue the steer for the next
turn, `Shift+Enter` interrupt, then steer. Clashes resolved: `x`
(dismiss, expand, mark seen) is dismiss, or acknowledge on an overlap,
with context on `+`/`-`; `e` (endorse, next error) is endorse, errors
move to `{`/`}`; `]`/`[` (next room, next edit, stack) are edits, rooms
move to `n`/`N`, the stack to `<`/`>`; `a` (allow, next held request) is
allow, replay held requests move to `;`/`:`; `r` (reply, verdict,
replay) is reply, the verdict sheet moves to `C`, replay to tab `3`; `c`
(copy, post on the selection) is post, copy moves to `y`; `p` (pause,
previous post with a range link, steer with an address) is pause,
steering with an address moves to `m`; `.` (next turn, follow) is next
turn, follow moves to `F`; `Space` (select, peek, play) is peek, play
moves to `Shift+Space`; `Shift+A` is unbound, its earlier action
removed.
