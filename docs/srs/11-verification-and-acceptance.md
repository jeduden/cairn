# 11. Verification and acceptance

## 11.1 Evaluation plan

Evaluation runs in a separate module (`cairn-eval`) with versioned datasets
and fixed seeds so every result is reproducible. **All acceptance evaluations
MUST use the Claude models and Claude Code versions used in production**, with
at least three repetitions and reported confidence intervals. Published numbers
from other systems are reference points only.

**Baselines:** (base-0) plain Claude Code; (base-1) Claude Code with
lossless-claude/lcm; (C) Cairn full; (C−L) Cairn without landmarks; (C−K) Cairn
without kernel.

## 11.2 Definition of done for v1.0

1. Every P0 requirement implemented and verified by its stated method; every P1
   implemented or deferred with signed-off rationale.
2. All assumptions in §2.3 verified or their dependent requirements re-planned.
3. Evaluation (§11.1) run and published in the repository, with all hard targets
   met.
4. External security review against §6 completed, with no open high or critical
   findings.
5. Two-week pilot on a production runner pool with zero data loss, zero
   agent-blocking incidents, and every non-zero failure counter explained.
6. Documentation complete (NFR-14).
