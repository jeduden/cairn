# 1.3 Invariants

The invariants are Cairn's contract. Every requirement serves at least one of
them. A change that would break an invariant is a design change requiring
security review and a new major version, not a bug fix.

- **I1 — Nothing is lost.** Every event an agent saw or produced remains
  recoverable by its stable address, (writer, seq), across any number of
  compactions and agent runs, on every node that holds its writer's log. The
  only exceptions are secrets removed by redaction before storage or on import,
  and data the node's principal explicitly purges, or removes under a retention
  policy that principal or managed policy sets. Every exception is recorded.
- **I2 — No automatic path from untrusted content to the model.** Content that
  originates outside the trusted sources (tool output, web, MCP servers, files,
  the model's replies, and anything another node or principal produced, except
  the agent's principal's acts signed by a device key it certified, posts and
  pins written from a device seat such a key certified, a pin version that
  principal stamped, or what a trust grant of that principal covers) reaches the
  model only inside an untrusted-data envelope when the agent explicitly calls a
  recall tool, or through one of the closed paths below that a principal act
  names. The trusted sources are this node's own `operator` and structural
  events, the `harness_meta` events its hook handlers witnessed, and the `user`
  turns they witnessed while the deployment mode is `interactive`, and, once
  PRV-10 ships, principal acts signed by a device key the agent's principal
  certified and posts and pins written from a device seat such a key certified,
  within that key's scope, a pin version a principal stamped, for that
  principal's own agents, and the posts and pins a trust grant of the agent's
  principal covers. Cairn writes to an agent only through a closed set of paths.
  Without a principal act: restore blocks (INJ-01, INJ-02, INJ-04), built only
  from qualifying pins, trusted structural fields and fixed text Cairn ships;
  and opt-in notices (INJ-10), compaction guidance (PIN-07) and the fixed
  templates of OWN-04 and OWN-07, each built only from fixed text Cairn ships,
  trusted structural fields and ids. On a principal act recorded at that time:
  through the harness's own input, only principal-typed text, a fixed template
  that references ids, or a post a principal endorsed exactly as shown inside
  the template of OWN-08. Under a delegation grant its principal recorded
  (OWN-23), and, for an agent of another principal, an acceptance grant that
  agent's principal recorded (OWN-26): a delegated task inside the fixed
  template of OWN-24. Once its requirements ship, a principal may also trust
  another principal by key for its own agents, in one room or everywhere; the
  pins that principal wrote from device seats one of its device keys certified
  then restore to those agents, and its posts reach them inside the fixed
  template of OWN-29. Cairn applies such grants and never grants trust itself.
  No other write to an agent exists.
- **I3 — Constraints are never summarized.** Every pin that restores is stored
  verbatim and restored verbatim after every compaction, or named by id and
  count when the budget omits it.
- **I4 — Each component stays inside one declared network boundary, and only the
  core builds what reaches the model.** B0, the core (hook handlers, the MCP
  server, the kernel worker, the CLI, the TUI and everything that builds what
  reaches the model), opens no socket and makes no outbound connection. B1,
  machine: a component may listen only on loopback or on a local endpoint only
  the same OS user can reach, and connect nowhere else; the launcher carries
  into the harness's input only text the core built. B2, peer: encrypted,
  mutually authenticated connections to nodes and paired phones the node's
  principal enrolled by key, off until that principal turns it on. B3, public:
  read-only publishing and outbound exchange with hosts the node's principal
  names, off until turned on. Managed policy can disable B1, B2 and B3. No
  component sends telemetry or depends on a central or third-party service. Data
  leaves the machine only as recalled content an agent receives through a tool
  call, or as what Cairn writes to an agent through I2's closed paths, both of
  which the harness sends to its model, or through a B2 or B3 component the
  node's principal turned on; whatever such a component brings in is trusted
  only as I2 allows.
- **I5 — Bad data can be removed from circulation without destroying the
  record.** Any event, span, run, writer or derived artifact can be
  quarantined from recall immediately on the node that records the quarantine,
  while the record stays intact for forensics. A quarantine reaches another
  node only as a quarantine request that node's principal applies.
- **I6 — No silent failures.** Every dropped, rejected, redacted, timed-out,
  or failed operation is counted, logged, and visible to the node's principal.
- **I7 — Harness configuration changes only on explicit instruction.** Cairn
  changes harness configuration only through explicit install and uninstall
  operations, shows the change first, and never overrides managed policy or the
  harness's managed settings.
- **I8 — Isolation follows the principal.** All local state is bound to one
  principal's home with strict permissions, and Cairn refuses to operate on a
  home that does not belong to the OS user running it. Content another principal
  wrote, or another node wrote other than this principal's acts signed by a
  device key it certified and its posts and pins written from a device seat such
  a key certified, is kept as theirs: attributed to its seat key, and untrusted
  unless this principal's own stamp or trust grant covers it. On its own it
  never makes this principal's agents trust it, nor extends their recall.
- **I9 — Cairn never degrades the agent.** A Cairn failure never blocks or
  slows the agent beyond defined budgets. Cairn fails open, except where
  continuing would violate I2, I4, or I8.
- **I10 — Everything derived is rebuildable.** All derived artifacts (indexes,
  landmarks, active pins, quarantine set, statuses, queues, evidence and proof
  classes, stats) are a deterministic function of the set of writer logs a node
  holds and the node's own key set, independent of the order in which logs
  arrived. Rebuilding reproduces them exactly.
