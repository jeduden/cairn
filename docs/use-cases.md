summary: >-
  Pending use cases, one file each under docs/use-cases, before the
  SRS covers them: who wants each, what it is, the milestone it targets
  and its status. Not normative; an entry moves into the SRS when a plan
  takes it up.

# Use cases

This index collects use cases the SRS does not cover yet, so that none
of them lives only in a chat. It is not normative: the SRS decides what
Cairn does. When a plan takes an entry up, it lands as a domain-model
concept, requirement rows and `@pending` scenarios, and its entry then
names those requirement ids.

## Format

Each use case is one file, `docs/use-cases/UC-<nnn>.md`. It holds only
its front matter and its title. mdsmith checks the front matter against
the `use-case` kind in `.mdsmith.yml`. The table below is built from
it. The fields:

- **id:** `UC-` and three digits, matching the file name; never reused.
- **title:** a short name, repeated as the file's heading.
- **summary:** the use case, one sentence of at most 40 words, with no
  design in it.
- **personas:** one or more of U1 to U9, as SRS §2.5 lists them.
- **milestone:** one milestone of SRS §12.2 (`M7`), a range
  (`M7 to M9`), or `unplanned` while none is chosen yet.
- **status:** `pending`, `specified` or `shipped`.
- **requirements:** left out while pending; once the entry is
  specified, the requirement ids that carry it.
