summary: >-
  The security reviewer's record of Cairn's ten invariants as they stand
  in docs/srs/invariants.md: the initial contract, accepted once the

  It replaces the change records of the draft, and every later change to

# ADR-2610091555: The initial invariants

## Context

Cairn is pre-implementation. While the SRS and the domain model were
drafted, the invariants (§1.3, [invariants.md](../srs/invariants.md))
were reworded many times, and each rewording got its own security-review
record: 20 decision records from SRS 2.0 to 2.7. None of those wordings
ever shipped, so the records describe a draft rather than a contract.

[ENG-29](../srs/10-engineering-quality.md#104-process) lets a change to an
invariant land only with an accepted record of a named human security
reviewer's approval. Until a security reviewer is named, the stakeholder,
@jeduden, holds that role (CLAUDE.md, Review).

## Decision

The ten invariants I1 to I10 are Cairn's initial contract. Their text is
the one [docs/srs/invariants.md](../srs/invariants.md) holds in the commit
that adds this record. The file's SHA-256 is:

```text
3d669831fe07f49646b8a7cff9a15ae133ec70592f7ab5e56de042d63a8240ec
```

The stakeholder approves this record, as security reviewer, by a comment
on the pull request that adds it, naming the record's id and the hash
above. That comment is the approval ENG-29 asks for, and it can be
checked apart from this record. The record turns accepted with a link
to it; until then it is proposed, and no invariant change rests on it.

This record replaces the draft's change records, which are deleted; git
history keeps them. The invariants' single source stays invariants.md,
which CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and README include.

## Alternatives

- **Keep the 20 change records.** They document how a draft evolved, not
  what Cairn promises, and every reader had to replay them to learn the
  current wording.
- **Delete them with no replacement.** ENG-29 would then have no recorded
  approval for the wording every later change is measured against.

## Consequences

- Any change to an invariant from here on is a design change (§1.3): it
  needs a new accepted record with a named security reviewer's approval
  (ENG-29) that supersedes this one (ENG-26), and a new major version.
- The domain-model convergence loop never edits invariant wording; a
  finding that would need it goes to the stakeholder.
- The file's hash above lets a reviewer check that invariants.md still
  matches what was approved.
