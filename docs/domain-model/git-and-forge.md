# Git and forge

- **Repository**: A git repository, identified by its **repository identity**, a
  bound root commit, the same on every node with a git clone, else a
  provisional node-local identity bound later (LANE-02). It has remotes and may
  carry room trailers in its commits and bundles as git refs.
- **Branch**: A git branch, identified by repository identity, remote URL and
  branch name (LANE-01). It belongs to the first of this node's principal's
  rooms whose branch link names it, concurrent links resolving by Room merge
  (LANE-01, LANE-31). So only that room takes a run's events on it, and the
  room trailer of each commit on it names that room (LANE-28). It moves only
  when a room enters or leaves those rooms or a concurrent branch link arrives
  (LANE-01); events recorded and commits made before it moves keep their room.
  Whether a link another principal's seat wrote may win a concurrent tie over
  one a seat of this node's principal wrote is open (OQ-46).
- **Commit**: A git commit.
- **Commit author**: Git's author of a commit, never a seat.
- **Worktree**: A git working tree on a node, where a run edits a branch; its
  repository's **git directory** is git's own store of objects and refs.
- **Forge**: The service that keeps remotes, pull requests, reviews and branch
  protection, and approves and lands; its **forge reports** count as `asserted`
  (LANE-08).
- **Pull request**: The forge's review object for a branch.
- **Check**: A command executed, or expected to execute because one of the
  intent's criteria names it (LANE-20), on a tree, with its exit status once it
  ends; its **check state** is one of §9.7.2's. A check the forge reports, one
  of its **required checks** included, is a forge report, not a result.
- **Result**: What a room's seats established: a check passing or failing on a
  **tree** (git's snapshot of a commit's files), or a claim stated in text. It
  names the intent version and carries one evidence class; it is derived from
  the events it rests on and addressed by the event recording its exit status or
  its claim's text.
- **Evidence**: The checks, CI attestations or text a result rests on.
- **Evidence class**: Of a result, ranked: `claim` < `own check` < `witness
  check` < `CI attested` (LANE-05).
- **Own check**: A check the hook handlers recorded on the editing run's node,
  on the latest worktree checkpoint plus the edits recorded since (LANE-05).
- **Witness check**: A check re-run through the launcher, outside any agent
  context, on a fresh checkout of the exact commit, by a node whose **git
  identity** (the author and commit-signing identities its git configuration
  sets) authored no commit on the branch since it left its base (OWN-18).
- **CI attestation**: A check's exit status for the exact commit, signed by a CI
  key the room's owner enrolled and recorded in the room (LANE-05, LANE-22).
- **Landing**: Git or the forge merging commits into the repository's default
  branch or a branch the forge protects; a landing is never a verdict. A branch
  lands when its head lands.
- **Landing link**: The qualified link from a landed commit to a room, carrying
  a proof class, derived from the record alone (LANE-06).
- **Proof class**: Of a landing link. Proven: `same commit`, `same patch`, `same
  tree`. Not proven: `likely`, `asserted`, and `not proven` with a reason
  (LANE-06).
- **Room trailer**: The `Cairn-Room:` line Cairn adds to the message of each
  commit on a room's branch, naming the room; each `Cairn-Link:` line is a
  trailer link (LANE-28).
- **Qualified links**: Every link is named by what it connects: a branch link
  (room to branch), a pull-request link (branch to its pull request, derived by
  Cairn from forge bridge events), a
  criterion link (result to criterion), a range link (post or pin to an address
  range), a parent link (subagent run to parent run), a delegation link
  (delegating run to the delegate's run, under a delegation grant), an invite
  link (which connects nothing: it carries an access token), a landing link and
  a trailer link (commit to a pin, post or marked range). "Link" never stands
  alone, except in the link act (Room act).
- **Comparison**: A side-by-side view of two branches: each one's exposure,
  results and evidence. It picks no winner.
- **Outcome**: What a room's runs have produced so far: the heads of the
  branches it names, their results and evidence, as verdicts assess them.
- **Presentation**: What a seat put in the outcome window, such as a dev
  server's URL, a build artifact, a file or a diff, with the seat and branch
  (VIEW-22).
- **Verdict**: A person's `met`, `not met` or `needs changes` on one criterion:
  a `verdict` pin, recorded as a neutral principal act bound to the intent
  version, the heads of every branch the room names on the recording node, and
  the results and evidence shown (OWN-27). It goes stale when one of them
  changes, never because the room names a branch it does not list, on another
  node or later. A newer verdict of the same person on the same criterion
  supersedes it. Service accounts contribute evidence instead.
